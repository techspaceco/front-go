# front-api

Unofficial [Front](https://front.com) Version 1 - OpenAPI 3 specification.

The [Front Public API](https://dev.frontapp.com) is designed to let 3rd party applications communicate
with the core [Front](https://front.com) platform. Unfortunately the developer documentation is provided
as-is, in HTML, without a specification.

This unofficial specification is provided for all your code generation needs.

## WARNING

**UNSAFE:** [Front](https://front.com) only publish a major version number so this specification may not match
the documentation or API if the endpoints used by [Techspace](https://techspace.co) remain functional. It is provided
on a best effort basis.
